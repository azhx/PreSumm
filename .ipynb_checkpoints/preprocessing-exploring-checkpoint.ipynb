    "New York City (NYC), often called simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817 distributed over about 302.6 square miles (784 km2), New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the U.S. state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban landmass. With almost 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce, entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy.\n",
    "Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbors, New York City is composed of five boroughs, each of which is a county of the State of New York. The five boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island—were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United States. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. New York is home to more than 3.2 million residents born outside the United States, the largest foreign-born population of any city in the world as of 2016. As of 2019, the New York metropolitan area is estimated to produce a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of $2.0 trillion. If the New York metropolitan area were a sovereign state, it would have the eighth-largest economy in the world. New York is home to the highest number of billionaires of any city in the world.\n",
    "New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded by colonists from the Dutch Republic in 1624 on Lower Manhattan; the post was named New Amsterdam in 1626. The city and its surroundings came under English control in 1664 and were renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York. The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was subsequently renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674. New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790, and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790. The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace. In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship, and environmental sustainability, and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity. In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.\n",
    "Many districts and landmarks in New York City are well known, including three of the world's ten most visited tourist attractions in 2013. A record 62.8 million tourists visited New York City in 2017. Times Square is the brightly illuminated hub of the Broadway Theater District, one of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, and a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Many of the city's landmarks, skyscrapers, and parks are known around the world. Manhattan's real estate market is among the most expensive in the world. Providing continuous 24/7 service and contributing to the nickname The City that Never Sleeps, the New York City Subway is the largest single-operator rapid transit system worldwide, with 472 rail stations. The city has over 120 colleges and universities, including Columbia University, New York University, Rockefeller University, and the City University of New York system, which is the largest urban public university system in the United States. Anchored by Wall Street in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan, New York City has been called both the world's leading financial center and the most financially powerful city in the world, and is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.\n",

       "'tuberculosis ( tb ) is caused by the mycobacterium tuberculosis , a member of the m. tuberculosis complex ( mtbc ) . according to the world health organization ( who ) , in 2010 , there were an estimated 12.0 million prevalent cases of tb ( equivalent to 178 cases per 100000 individuals ) and approximately 1.4 million people died of tb during that year . most of the cases in 2009 ( 55% ) occurred in asia ( 1 ) . according to the  administration of tuberculosis and leprosy control  of the ministry of health and medical education in iran , in 2010 , a total of 10485 old and new cases of tb were reported in iran and of these cases , 326 patients ( around 2.2% ) were hiv positive ( 2 ) . the diseases caused by mycobacterium complex have become more important in the recent years , particularly in association with the worldwide pandemic situation caused by human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) . in 2010 , in addition , there were an estimated 0.35 million deaths among tb cases that were hiv - positive . according to who , the incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in hiv - positive patients in iran was 0.38 ( 0.28 - 0.51 ) per 100000 individuals in 2012 ( 3 ) . some opportunistic microorganisms such as nocardia spp . are gram - positive ( weakly acid fast ) and filamentous with a branching appearance and are not part of the normal human bacterial flora . to date at least sixteen species capable of producing disease in humans have been identified ( 4 ) . pulmonary disease is the predominant clinical presentation of this microorganism and can be fatal if untreated . untreated pulmonary nocardiosis is similar to tuberculosis and n. asteroids is the most frequent cause of pulmonary infection in humans ( 85% ) ( 5 ) . since the clinical and radiological manifestations are non - specific , pulmonary nocardiosis could be mistaken with other infections or other bacterial pneumonia . in addition , nocardiosis may be under reported because it is not among the aids - defining criteria ( 6 ) . diagnosis of pulmonary nocardiosis is dependent on the isolation or demonstration of the organism from respiratory secretions such as sputum or tissue specimens . nocardia as a m. tuberculosis is a slow growing organism that requires prolonged incubation for at least 4 - 6 weeks ( 7 ) . the diagnosis of nocardiosis is currently based on direct examination and conventional culture ; serology is usually not useful . treatment of nocardiosis is different from tuberculosis regarding therapeutic agents , route of administration and duration of therapy ( 8) . sulfonamides have been the agents of choice for the treatment of nocardiosis , however combination therapy with two or more agents is recommended . although nocardiosis is an uncommon illness , co - infection of this disease with tuberculosis has been reported ( 9 ) . the aim of this study was to assess the presence of nocardia spp . and m. tuberculosis in sputum specimens of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis . in the meantime , 32 hiv - infected patients who were suspected of having pulmonary tuberculosis were included in this study in order to evaluate concomitant infection in these patients . a total of 189 sputum samples were obtained from the reference mycobacteriology laboratory , ahvaz jundishapur university of medical sciences from march 2011 to april 2012 . all specimens were processed immediately according to standard routine diagnosis procedures by the naoh / n - acetyl - l - cysteine ( nalc ) method . next , concentrated specimens were used for smear preparation , culture and pcr assay ( 10 , 11 ) . furthermore , 250 l of each concentrated sputum specimen was inoculated onto lowenstein - jensen ( l - j ) media ( merck , germany ) . are acid fast and can survive the decontamination of clinical specimens with sodium hydroxide and nalc methods , thereby , they can grow on l - j medium . cultures were examined weekly and after 8 weeks of incubation , cultures , which showed no growth , were reported negative and discarded . for microscopic examination , using a disposable pasteur pipette , one drop of the sediment of the sputum specimen was spread on each clean microscope slide and after air drying and fixation by heat , the smears were stained by ziehl - neelsen and gram staining ( 10 ) . after decontamination , the chromosomal dna was extracted using proteinase k and phenol : chloroform , and then precipitated by ethanol and isopropanol , according to standard procedures ( 12 ) . the purified dna was amplified with specific pairs of primers is1 ( 5ctcgtccagcgccgcttcgg 3 ) and is2 ( 5cctgcgagcgtaggcggtgg 3 ) for m. tuberculosis complex strains ann microbiol . the pcr protocols were optimized to 35 cycles consisting of 45 seconds at 94c for denaturation , 30 seconds at 68c for annealing and 30 seconds at 72c for extension , followed by a final 5 minute extension at 72c . primers ng1 ( 5ctcgtccagcgccgcttcgg3 ) and ng2 ( 5cctgcgagcgtaggcggtgg3 ) were used to amplify a nocardia genus specific 590-bp fragment of 16s rrna . the pcr protocols were optimized to 40 cycles consisting of 45 seconds at 94c for denaturation , 30 seconds at 57c for annealing and 30 seconds at 72c for extension , followed by a final 5 minute extension at 72c . amplification with these primers was observed by electrophoresis on 2% ( w / v ) agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide ( figure 1 ) . the n. asteroides atcc 19247 and m. tuberculosis h37rv were used as positive reference strains . two pcrs for each sample were performed in separate tubes with two pairs of primers . one set was dedicated to the m. tuberculosis complex , whereas the other set was for nocardia spp . for each round of pcr the investigators were blinded to clinical data during the experiment for detection of microbial agents co - infection . all specimens were unnamed and labeled by a secure code in the reference mycobacteriology laboratory . a : clinical sample of m. tuberculosis . a total of 189 sputum samples were obtained from the reference mycobacteriology laboratory , ahvaz jundishapur university of medical sciences from march 2011 to april 2012 . all specimens were processed immediately according to standard routine diagnosis procedures by the naoh / n -
